 Recursion :
 
* Recursion is when a method calls itself to break a problem into smaller parts.
* Useful for repetitive calculations like compound interest or predicting trends.
* Example: To calculate next year's value, use current value and growth rate recursively.

	      Time Complexity Analysis
	    
	      Recursive Forecast:
	        - Time Complexity: O(n), where n = number of years
	        - One call for each year
	     
	       Optimization Tip:
	         - Use iteration instead of recursion to avoid deep call stack.
	         - Or use memoization if previous values are reused.
